        <p class="captions">DAP 2! This the v2 version of DAP. DAP stands for "Darked: A Platformer." This version is better, but still in a work in progress (and will probably be for a loooong time). The platformer engine is just straight up pulled from DAP 1. Ethan Fu created it, because I don't like Scratch for platformers.</p>

        <p class="captions">A game related to DAP (1 and 2, I guess) and the upcoming Failure's Journey! It's not realy a game, as it was created as a test and to see if I'm good at making decoration for levels (that's new!). This time, it's made by me, and I just pulled the engine from <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/crazyhenryj/">@crazyhenryj</a> (go check him out (you can click the name)), Ethan Fu told me how to do the decoration thing. I'll explain it below.</p>

        <p class="captions">There are 3 sprites (basically 1 for every mechanic): the solid, hazard (things that kill you), and things that bounce. There is then a fourth one which has the decoration. All of the sprites are all in the same position, (0, 0). All other sprites (expect the ball (which is the player), of course), get's hidden, using a [ set ghost effect to ( 100 ) ] rather than [ hide ], so the collision still works.</p>

        <p class="captions">This is also supposed to be the guantlets in Failure's Journey, which is an upcoming game made by me and Ethan Fu.</p>
