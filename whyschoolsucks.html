        <!-- NOT using the list element because I don't like it -->
        <p>1. They make you carry <b>LOADS</b> of stuff</p>
        <p>2. It makes us go up and down the stairs even though there is another teacher on the same floor</p>
        <p>3. They are sexist. I'm gonna explain this one in the paragraph below:</p>
        <p>Ok so basically here's why school is sexist. They praise girls <b>over</b> boys. Here's an example:</p>
        <p>At school, there are 2 students. One of them is a girl and the other is a boy. The girl is BAREFOOT, but the boy is wearing slightly-open shoes.</p>
        <p>Guess who get's yelled at?</p>
        <p>Of course... THEY YELL AT THE BOY!!</p>
        <p>That's proof that they are sexist.</p>
